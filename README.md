# mind-time



### App Description

Created for my capstone at Galvanize Denver, this is a project I wanted to build for a long time. Mind Time is a Native application that allows useres to sort through a lists of meditations and intreact with other users. 

### Problem Statement

Finding time for meditating difficult. We all have busy lives and itâ€™s hard to make time for yourself especially when  you are stressed in life. Connection with others meditations are always better in groups with those you care about than by oneself. 


### User Experience 

Users can toggle three views, 1) find a meditation by button form, 2) Browse Meditation list, 3) Chat room.

 #### Main screen
 
here the user can toggle the button settings to find the right meditation for you based off time of day, length of meditation and whether the user would prefer spoken word or musical.
